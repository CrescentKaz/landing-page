                    <span class="para"><p>I'm a nerd by any other name. I had a childhood dream job of working with fish so I got an associates of science and a bachelors of marine biology. After a few years as a lab tech I achieved my "dream job" but as most people will tell you, childhood dreams don't work out so well for adults. I left that position after about a year. I craved something that required troubleshooting and playing detective (root-cause analysis). So I transfered to quality assurance and it was here that I caught a glimpse of my new dream job. I wanted to "play" on computers. I chose to learn to code. I already knew Microsoft Office well enough and had toyed with a few basic lines in VBA. Now I wanted to see what else I could do. I took a class on Responsive Web Design and got <a rel="link-to-cert1" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/KRAJohnson/responsive-web-design" target="_blank" style="color: white">this certificate</a>. I started taking a python course and then a javascript course. I wrote up my first game but quickly realized  I needed a way to share it. This led me to GitHub Pages and here is the result so far. I plan on continuing to learn and grow as a developer. Please feel free to hit me up on the socials below. Thanks yall, and have a good one! </p></span>
