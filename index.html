                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <span class="para"><p>I'm a nerd by any other name. I had a childhood dream job of working with fish so I got an education in biology. After a few years as a lab tech I achieved my "dream job" but as most people will tell you, childhood dreams don't work out so well for adults. Craving something that required troubleshooting and playing detective (root-cause analysis), I transfered to quality assurance and it was here that I caught a glimpse of my new dream. I wanted to "play" on computers. I already knew Microsoft Office well enough and had toyed with a few basic lines in VBA so I took a class on Responsive Web Design and got <a rel="link-to-cert1" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/KRAJohnson/responsive-web-design" target="_blank" style="color: white">this certificate</a>. Then I started learning javascript and python. I wrote up my first game (Escape the Dragon) but quickly realized I needed a way to share it. This led me to GitHub Pages and learning about git and agile methodologies. Now I try to code stuff in my spare time. Please feel free to play with my projects and let me know what you think on the socials below. Thanks y'all, and have a good one! </p></span>

                        -> The CSS file must be attached in the Head, not the Header.<br>
                        -> The JS file must be attached at the bottom of the Main, NOT in the Head.<br>
                        -> JS doesn't like Python syntax.<br>
                        -> It's possible to build a website using a separate file per language and also possible to build one with all the CSS and JS embedded in the HTML file.<br>
                        -> JS can automatically change your HTML based off a variable of your choice (date, random number, time, etc.)<br>
                        -> Dropshadows increase the visability of text when you have a busy background image.<br>
                        -> Free artisitic sites like Canva and Google AI Art are your best friend. Just beware the TOS if you plan to monitize anything.<br>
                        -> The main difference between a static site and a dynamic one is if user-entered data is stored.<br>
                        -> The correct notation style is the one your current teammates understand.<br>
                        -> Waterfall is everyone working on the same task at the same time. Agile is divide and conquer.<br>
                        -> APIs are giant JS dictionaires.<br>
