                    <span class="para"><p>I'm a nerd by any other name. I had a childhood dream job of working with fish so I got an education in biology. After a few years as a lab tech I achieved my "dream job" but as most people will tell you, childhood dreams don't work out so well for adults. Craving something that required troubleshooting and playing detective (root-cause analysis), I transfered to quality assurance and it was here that I caught a glimpse of my new dream. I wanted to "play" on computers. I already knew Microsoft Office well enough and had toyed with a few basic lines in VBA so I took a class on Responsive Web Design and got <a rel="link-to-cert1" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/KRAJohnson/responsive-web-design" target="_blank" style="color: white">this certificate</a>. Then I started learning javascript and python. I wrote up my first game (Escape the Dragon) but quickly realized I needed a way to share it. This led me to GitHub Pages and learning about git and agile methodologies. Now I try to code stuff in my spare time. Please feel free to play with my projects and let me know what you think on the socials below. Thanks y'all, and have a good one! </p></span>
